Starter Kits usally consist of one Microcontroller, one shield and additional Sensors and Actuators. First think about what functions you want your system to have and what material is required. Talk to your Profesoor and listen to his recommendations.</p>
<p>Multisensor Shields are great way to start as they already contain most basic electronics. They directly connect to the Microcontroller and eliminated delicate and for some starters difficult wiring.</p>
<p>The most common Microcontrollers are Arduinos, they are easy to set up and have a very detailed description and helpful community. ESP Boards are also an alternative, they are comparabel cheap and easy to obtain.</p>

			<p>As the Microcontroller presents the core of the System it needs to be extended by a variaty of Electronics to interact with the Enviroment. They attach and communicate over the I/O Pins. First you can differentiate between <strong>Senders</strong> and <strong>Receivers,</strong> some Components may be both at the same time.</p>
<p>Senders send Signals to your Microcontroller to be able to measure and react to external Factors. You can have simple <strong>Buttons or Switches</strong> that send a simple HIGH or LOW signal. But also more complex <strong>Sensors or Antennas</strong> that send Information or Measurements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Receivers receive Signals from your Microcontroller and are able to influence the outside Enviroment. Many Receivers require a control signal and a source of energy. Most common are <strong>Actuators</strong>, they are responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system, like a DC Motor. In simple terms, it is a "mover". Additinionally a huge variaty of <strong>Light Sources,</strong> that can be combined to a display, or <strong>Sound Sources</strong> in form of Loudspeakers or Buzzers can be added to the system.</p>
<p>The Possibilities and Electronics availbale are Limitless, the Microcontoller can be configured and adjusted in many ways. A good way to start is with a shield, that houses most common Electronics or a preselected StarterKit. Some Starter Components are LEDs, Resistors, Buzzers, Potentiometer, Push-Buttons , DC Motors and Distance Sensors. They are relative Easy to use and should be sufficent for the First Tutorials.</p>
<p><strong>All electronic Components are described in detail in the Electronics Page.</strong></p>
